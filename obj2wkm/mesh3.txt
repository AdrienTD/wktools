26/02/2017-03/03/2017: Added more details about normals.

NAME		TYPE		MEANING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
sign		int		Signature ("Mesh")
version		int		Version (3 or 4)
unk1		int		Flags (?) (1 in most times)

--- Attachment points ---
nparts		short		Number of points
[
    tag		string		Tag
    offset	float[3]	Position of attachment point
    orientation	float[4]	Orientation " " "
    on		char		1=On, 0=Off
    attach	string		Path to a file to attach.
]

--- Positions ---
nverts		short		Number of positions
[
    pos		float[3]	Position
]

--- Sphere ---
sphere		float[4]	A sphere.

--- Position remapper ---
(Note: only exists if version == 3, doesn't exist when version == 4)
nposremaps	ushort		Number of elements.
[
    index	ushort		...
]

--- Normal triangle list (used to build Normals, see end of file) ---
nnorm		ushort		Number of normals
nele		uint		Number of elements

- Either this -
*nele times
[
    sm		ushort		Element
]
- or this -
*nnorm times
[
   nv		ushort		Number of triangles used to calculate the normal
   v		ushort[nv]	Index to triangle in the first polygon list
]
- -

--- Materials ---
nmat		ushort		Number of materials
[
    flag	char		1 = alpha test enabled, 0 = no alpha test
    file	string		Texture file name (in "Warrior Kings Game Set\Textures")
]

--- Texture coordinates ---
nuvlist		uint		Number of UV lists.
[
    ntexc	short		Number of texture coordinates
    [
        tc	float[2]	Texture coordinate
    ]
]

--- Groups ---
ngrp		uint		Number of groups
[
    sg		ushort
    [
        p	ushort		Index in position list
        n	ushort		Index in normal list
        t	ushort		Index of texture coordinate
    ]
]

--- Polygon lists ---
ntrilist	uint		Number of polygon lists

- For every polygon list -
polylist	ushort[3]	Polygon_List (can be ignored)
Sample_Distance	float		The distance at which the polygon list is used (can be ignored)

*nmat times
[
    sgrp	ushort		Size of part mapped to material
    vused	ushort		Number of vertices used
    matx	ushort		Material index (can be ignored)
    *sgrp times
    [
        tri	ushort[3]	Indices to vertices in corresponding group
    ]
]

--- Normals ---
*nnorm times
[
    n		uchar		Index of an entry in the "normal table"
]

Note that the normals must be reordered using the remapper if it exists!

The normal table contains 256 3D vectors. See wkNormalTable.bin which was
extracted from the RAM after running the game. Every vector in the
file is 12 bytes long and have 3 32-bits floating point coordinates.

--- Normal remapper ---
(Note: only exists if version == 3, doesn't exist when version == 4)
nnormremaps	ushort		Number of elements.
[
    index	ushort		...
]
