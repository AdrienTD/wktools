wkm3v is a program that loads and renders static .Mesh3 files as well as
animated .Anim3 files.

This program requires D3DX9_43.DLL to be installed on your computer.
If you get a message that this file is missing, then install it
from this link:

First you need the copy the Textures directory from "data.bcp\Warrior Kings Game Set"
to wkm3v's directory. (Use BCP Viewer to extract data.bcp.)
(You must in fact have the Textures directory in wkm3v's directory.)

To open a Mesh3/Anim3 file, you can simply drag & drop the .mesh3/.anim3 file
into wkm3v.exe

Please note that Anim3 files also need their corresponding Mesh3 files to be
in the same directory as the Anim3 files.
