This directory contains tools that will read game files and print information on the console.

I made them a long time ago, but I decided to release them because they can still be useful for debugging or if you want to better understand the WK's file formats.

The tools are:
 * bcma for bcm files
 * ltttview for lttt (Landscape Texture Translation Table?) files
 * wkanima for anim3 files
 * wkmtext for mesh3 files
