## Compilation

If you have Visual C++/Visual Studio/Windows SDK, open the respective command prompt, go to the directory of the tool and type "build".

The MESH3 Viewer (wkm3v) also needs D3DX_43 header and library, which you can get from the DirectX SDK June 2010.

Currently the tools only work on Windows, however some of them should also work with small modifications on other OSes.
